# Housing-Kaggle-Competition
this is the code I used in my first competition in Kaggle 

using The Libraries :
  Pandas 
  seaborn 
  matplotlib.pyplot
  numpy to clean and set the data for the model to train 

  also used the following library in the model training part

  sklearn.model_selection
    train_test_split 
  sklearn.metrics 
    mean_squared_error
  sklearn.linear_model 
    LinearRgression
  xgboost 
    XGBRegressor 
  sklearn.ensemble 
    RandomForestRegressor

These where the Algorithms I used to create three models and then I decided to use the XGBRegressor 
to make the predictions
